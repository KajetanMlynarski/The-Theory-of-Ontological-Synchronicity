# The Theory of Ontological Synchronicity: A Conceptual Framework
## By Kajetan Młynarski

### Introduction

This repository presents a coherent theoretical framework, termed the **Theory of Ontological Synchronicity**, which aims to unify fundamental concepts from physics, cognitive science, information theory, and ontology. The primary goal is to transcend the limitations of the causal-reductionist paradigm and propose a holistic, process-oriented model of reality.

The theory is based on the premise that **the whole is ontologically prior to its parts**, and the universe is a **synchronistic whole** defined by global informational constraints (`Γ`). In this view, phenomena such as time, gravity, consciousness, and intelligence are not fundamental "things" but **emergent processes** arising from the structure of this whole.

A key element of this framework is its ability to generate **experimentally verifiable predictions**, particularly in the realm of anomalous quantum correlations.

### Structure of the "Seed"

This repository serves as a canonical "seed" for the theory, providing a structured, machine-readable knowledge base.
