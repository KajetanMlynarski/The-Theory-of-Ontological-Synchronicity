# Theses on Ontological Synchronicity

This document outlines the core principles of the Theory of Ontological Synchronicity, based on the premise that the universe is a synchronistic whole.

### 1. Primacy of the Whole over the Parts
[cite_start]The synchronistic whole is well-defined and determines the properties of its parts[cite: 122]. [cite_start]These properties can be underdetermined, allowing for ontological randomness and the existence of possibilities (the space `Ω`)[cite: 123, 124]. [cite_start]In contrast, a causal whole is a secondary "emergence" from its fundamental parts[cite: 125, 126].

### 2. The Nature of Being within the Whole
[cite_start]The synchronistic whole *is* its elements, and the elements *are* the whole (to a certain degree) and each other[cite: 130]. [cite_start]The isolation and sovereignty of individual beings are emergent properties of the whole's structure[cite: 131, 1264]. [cite_start]This contrasts with reductionist set theory, where elements are radically distinct from the set and from each other[cite: 128, 129].

### 3. Cosmic Dimension of Local Actions
[cite_start]The universe transforms as a whole[cite: 1268]. [cite_start]Therefore, any local event, no matter how small (e.g., moving a brush on a table), changes the state of the entire universe[cite: 1269]. [cite_start]Every action has a cosmic dimension, which imbues it with meaning[cite: 1270, 1271].

### 4. Ontological Equality and Cosmic Responsibility
[cite_start]All beings that participate in the whole are ontologically equal[cite: 1273]. This leads to the concept of **cosmic responsibility**: not in a punitive sense, but in a creative one. [cite_start]Our actions are the very way in which the world transforms itself[cite: 1274, 1275]. [cite_start]This makes the idea of harmony—acting in accordance with the state of the whole—fundamentally important[cite: 1276].

### 5. Diagnosing the State of the Whole
[cite_start]While knowing the complete state of the universe is impossible, it is possible to diagnose its state by observing a specific class of random events and treating them as diagnostic probes[cite: 1278, 1279, 1280]. [cite_start]This is the rational principle behind practices like the I Ching divination[cite: 1281]. [cite_start]A scientific example is measuring the polarization of one entangled photon to instantly know the state of the other, thus determining the state of the whole (the pair)[cite: 1283, 1284].

### 6. Transcending the Mind-Body Problem
[cite_start]In the causal paradigm, the mind and the world are radically different entities, making problems like consciousness and qualia fundamentally unsolvable[cite: 1286]. [cite_start]In the synchronistic paradigm, where the subject and object are both projections of the same whole, these problems become tractable[cite: 1287].
